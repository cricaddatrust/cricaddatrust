Why The Current Model In India Is Unsustainable
Besides the impact of investment at a local level, there are clear and obvious reasons why the regulation of sports betting in India can be an overwhelmingly net positive for the country, sports betting experts believe. The Media research points out that India is a perfect microcosm for why authority is so desperately needed in a country where black market gambling is so rife. Their reports urge: "The prohibition of betting is widely seen to have been ineffective. In such contexts, certain authority recommendations cannot be overlooked. The Committee on Reforms in Cricket, the Law Commission of India, and recent court judgments (including by the Supreme Court) have suggested that betting should be regulated and taxed." It continues, "In a nation with widespread illegal betting and gambling (reportedly worth well over $100bn annually), criminal activity has had the chance to flourish and continues to engage public resources and law-enforcement efforts. Emerging markets (India in particular but not only) will benefit from creating their own Central regulatory framework, a Gambling oversight body, and a Consumer Data protection regulation.
